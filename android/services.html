	<h1>Services</h1>
	<p>A Service is an Android application component without a UI that runs on the main thread (of the hosting process).  If you want the service code to run in a Background Thread, then you must manage that yourself. </p>
	<p>There is a subclass of Service that handles it’s own Background Thread called IntentService.</p>
	<img src="images/services1.png">
	<p>The Service’s <code>onCreate()</code> method is called when it is created (by starting it or binding to it).</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It then spawns a Thread or an Executor some time after it has been created.</li>
			<li>When this Thread finishes, it lets the Service know that by calling <code>stopSelf()</code>. This is a very common pattern in Service implementations.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>The Service doesn’t know what is going on in the code running in your Thread or Executor task – it is your responsibility to let it know when you’ve started, and when you’ve finished.</p>	
	<p>Types of services</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Started Services</li>
		<li>Bound Services</li>
		<li>Bound and Started Services</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Started services</h2>
	<p>A Started Service can be started by calling the <code>startService(Intent)</code> method in your Activity or Service. This Intent has to be an explicit Intent.</p>
	<p>A Service can be started multiple times. Each time it is started, then <code>onStartCommand()</code> is called. A few parameters are passed to this command, along with any extras that are passed from your explicit Intent.</p>
	<p> In order to kill this Service, you have to ask it to stop by calling <code>stopSelf()</code>. When the Service does stop (after you’ve asked it) and there’s nothing else bound to it, then it will call <code>onDestroy()</code>.</p>
	<p> The component that launches the Service doesn’t really keep a connection to it, and if it needs to communicate something to the Started Service then it can start it again and pass it a different Intent. </p>
	<code>@TargetApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.O)<br>
    private void moveToStartedState() {<br>
    &emsp;    Intent intent = new MyIntentBuilder(this)<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;        .setCommand(Command.START).build();<br>
    &emsp;    if (isPreAndroidO()) {<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;        Log.d(TAG, "Running on Android N or lower");<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;        startService(intent);<br>
    &emsp;    } else {<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;        Log.d(TAG, "Running on Android O");<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;        startForegroundService(intent);<br>
    &emsp;    }<br>
    }<br>
	</code>
	<p>When you want to take your Started Service out of foreground execution, you can call <code>stopForeground(true)</code>. This will also take away the persistent notification. However, this will not stop the service. In order to do that you still have to call <code>stopSelf()</code>.</p>
	<h2>Bound services</h2>
	<p>Bound Services allow a connection to be established between the Android component binding to the Service, and the Service. This connection is an IBinder which allows methods to be called on the Service.</p>
	<p>if the Service (Bound or Started) needs to send messages to the bound client or whatever component started a Service, it has to use something like LocalBroadcastManager when the the client and Service are local to one process. </p>
	<code>
		private val mServiceConnection = object : ServiceConnection {<br>
		<br>
        override fun onServiceConnected(name: ComponentName, service: IBinder) {<br>
        &emsp;     val binder = service as PlayerForegroundService.LocalBinder<br>
        &emsp;     mService = binder.getService()<br>
        &emsp;     mBound = true<br>
        }<br>
        <br>
        override fun onServiceDisconnected(name: ComponentName) {<br>
        &emsp;     mService = null<br>
        &emsp;     mBound = false<br>
        }<br>
    }<br>
	</code>
	<code> context?.bindService(Intent(context, PlayerForegroundService::class.java), mServiceConnection,
            Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE)</code>
    <br>
    <code>
    	public class MyService extends Service{
    	&emsp;	public boolean onUnbind(Intent i){
        &emsp;&emsp;		return false;
    	&emsp;	}
		}
    </code>
    <p>Typically, you will return false. If you don’t, then when the next client binds to the Bound Service, then <code>onRebind()</code> will be called, instead of <code>onBind()</code>.</p>
    <p>A client binding to a Service will call <code>onCreate()</code>. If you don’t move your Service to a Started State, then when the client unbinds from the Service, it will be killed and it’s <code>onDestroy()</code> method will be called.</p>
    <img src="images/bound_services.png" width="75%">
    <p><code>onStartCommand</code> returns one of the following constants:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>START_NOT_STICKY - service will not restart after it was killed by the system</li>
    	<li>START_STICKY - service will restart after it was killed by the system</li>
    	<li>START_REDELIVER_INTENT - service will restart after it was killed by the system. Apart from that, service will receive all calls to <code>startService</code> that were not finished by method <code>stopSelf(startId)</code>.</li>
    </ul>
