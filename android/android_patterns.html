	<h1>Patterns in Android</h1>
	<p><em>“Is there anywhere in this project where I’ll have to change the same thing in multiple places?” – Future You</em></p>
	<ol>
		<li>Creational (how you create objects)
			<p><em>“When I need a particular complex object, how do I get one?” – Future You</em></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Builder<br>
			<code>AlertDialog.Builder(this)<br>
  .setTitle("Metaphorical Sandwich Dialog")<br>
  .setMessage("Metaphorical message to please use the spicy mustard.")<br>
  .setNegativeButton("No thanks", { dialogInterface, i -><br>
    // "No thanks" button was clicked<br>
  })<br>
  .setPositiveButton("OK", { dialogInterface, i -><br>
    // "OK" button was clicked<br>
  })<br>
  .show()<br></code>
  				</li>
  				<li>Dependency injection</li>
  				<p>Dependency injection has you provide any objects required when you instantiate a new object; the new object doesn’t need to construct or customize the objects itself.</p>
  				<p>Commonly implemented using Dagger 2.</p>
  				<li>Singleton</li>
  				<p>The Kotlin <em>object</em> keyword is used to declare a singleton</p>
  				<code>
  					object ExampleSingleton {<br>
  					&emsp; 	fun exampleMethod() {<br>
    				&emsp; &emsp; 		// ...<br>
  					&emsp; 	}<br>
					}

  				</code>
  			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Structural (how you compose objects)
			<p><em>“So when I open up this class, how will I remember what’s it’s doing and how it’s put together?” – Future You</em></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Adapter
					<p>In software terms, this pattern lets two incompatible classes work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface the client expects.</p>
					<p>List of people - RecyclerView doesn’t know what a Person is. Instead, it’s the adapter’s job to handle the data and send the bind command to the correct ViewHolder.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Facade
					<p>The Facade pattern provides a higher-level interface that makes a set of other interfaces easier to use. </p>

					<p>If your Activity needs a list of books, it should be able to ask a single object for that list without understanding the inner workings of your local storage, cache, and API client</p>
					<p>Retrofit from Square is an open-source Android library that helps you implement the Facade pattern.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Behavioral (how you coordinate object interactions)
			<p><em>“So… how do I tell which class is responsible for what?” – Future You</em></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Command
					<p>When you order some excellent Saag Paneer at an Indian restaurant, you don’t necessarily know which cook will prepare your dish; you only give your order to the waiter, who posts the order in the kitchen for the next available cook.</p>
					<p>Similarly, the Command pattern lets you issue requests without knowing the receiver.</p>
					<p>EventBus</p>
